# YouTube Beatmaker Cues - Chrome Extension

> This extension was inspired by the muscle memory workflow of the OP-Z, the versatility of Ableton Live, and the hands-on approach I developed over the years using the SP-404.

Mark cue points, loop audio/video, apply live effects, and customize your beatmaking experience on YouTube.

The **YouTube Beatmaker Cues** extension supports precise pitch adjustments, audio and video looping, effects toggling, and intuitive cue management. Use keyboard shortcuts or the detailed Advanced Panel for quick control.
## New in 1.4
* Four independent audio loopers with bright progress bars beneath the looper button
* Each bar shows four tick marks so you can follow the beat
* Progress bars are a uniform 1.4‚Äâpx thick
* Export downloads every active loop as its own track with BPM
* Pitching loops renames files with `-pitched-<BPM>bpm`


## New in 1.3
* Works inside the YouTube iframe on [Samplette.io](https://samplette.io) and other `youtube-nocookie.com` embeds, even when the referrer is hidden. The toolbar becomes scrollable and MIDI features are disabled there.
* Minimal bar and advanced window become scrollable when space is limited
* Route audio to any available output device via the **Audio Out** dropdown ("Default output" preselected)
* Choose your microphone via the **Audio In** dropdown ("Default input" preselected)
* Choose a device from the **Monitor In** dropdown and toggle **Mon On/Off** to hear that source through your computer's default speakers. Monitoring starts off on each page load and stops cleanly when you navigate away.
* Output routing adjusts automatically when selecting a new device
* Lower latency when switching outputs using native sink routing when supported
* Input monitoring uses a separate low-latency `AudioContext` for minimal delay
* Advanced control buttons now display in two columns for easier access
* **Super Knob** scrolls cues using any MIDI CC. Endless encoders behave like
  regular 0‚Äì127 knobs for now. Hold **Shift** to reposition before continuing
  and choose a speed (1‚Äì3) in the MIDI mapping window. Speed **1** is the
  default, with **2** and **3** moving cues faster.
* Avoids duplicate initialization in YouTube iframes to prevent freezes
* Mic button cycles Off ‚Üí Record (green) ‚Üí Monitor (red) so you can hear the mic while capturing loops
* Adjust cue points live using a single MIDI knob

(Thanks for the video Noche !)

The extension supports managing multiple sample packs at once. Use the multi-
select dropdown in the advanced panel to load several packs together or delete
unused ones. Creating a new pack only asks for a name; you can later import
kicks, hihats and snares using each row‚Äôs "Imp" button. Samples are stored in
the pack and persist between sessions. You can delete individual samples from
any pack; built-in samples remain protected, but extra ones you add to the
built-in pack can be removed.

Manage multiple compressors (Native, Tape Warm, Roland SP404OG) to shape your audio character. Adjust settings effortlessly through a user-friendly interface.

Integrate MIDI controllers with customizable mappings to trigger cues, samples, and effects directly.

Samples and cue points persist between sessions. Easily export loops, manage cues, and maintain workflow efficiency.

## Key Features

- üéØ **Cue Points**  
  Set up to 10 visual cue points on any YouTube video. Use keyboard shortcuts or drag & drop markers.

- üîÅ **Audio & Video Loopers**
  Record loops in sync with video or audio. Use `R`, `S`, `D`, or `F` to control
  up to four separate audio loops. The first loop sets the tempo automatically;
  additional loops stay synced to that BPM. Recording a new loop while others
  play adds it seamlessly without restarting. Press another loop key during
  playback to queue a new recording for the next bar. Loops keep the exact length you
  recorded‚Äîautomatic trimming has been removed to avoid cutting short sounds.
  Double press a loop key to stop **that** loop at the end of the bar. Hold the
  second press a moment longer (or tap three times quickly) to erase only the
  selected loop‚Äîthe button blinks briefly when this happens. Loops can be
  resumed individually with a single press; they start right away in sync with
  any loops already playing thanks to a short scheduling buffer. Sync has been refined so multiple loops stay locked together. If no loops are active they wait for the next bar
  and become the new **master** automatically. Should that loop stop, the
  master role passes to the next playing loop. Exporting downloads each
  active loop as its own track with the BPM rounded in the file name. If loops
  are pitched, the filenames also include `-pitched-<BPM>bpm`. Use `V` for the
  video looper. Hold Option and press **Cmd+R** to erase **all** loops. Use
  Cmd+R/S/D/F individually to erase loops A‚ÄìD or Cmd+V for the video loop. Each
  looper button now has a compact progress bar tucked beneath it with four tick
marks showing the current bar, and the button itself pulses in time while
recording. Loopers A‚ÄìC use cyan, magenta and yellow bars, while Looper¬†D uses
orange. All four progress bars are a bright 1.4‚ÄØpx thick for better visibility.
Hold the mapped **MIDI Shift** note while pressing any loop note to erase that
loop instantly. The progress bars speed up or slow down when loops are pitched
so the visuals stay in sync.

- üéöÔ∏è **Pitch Control**  
  Independent pitch control for video and loop playback. When targeting loops,
  the pitch slider adjusts all four audio loopers together and exported files
  include the modified pitch. If loops are pitched when exporting, each file
  name ends with `-pitched-<BPM>bpm` where `<BPM>` reflects the new tempo.
  Export uses offline rendering for reliability.

- üéõÔ∏è **Live Effects**  
  Toggle EQ (`E`), Compressor (`C`), Reverb (`Q`), and Cassette (`W`) in real time.

- üëÅÔ∏è **Minimal & Advanced UI**  
  Choose between a clean minimal bar or a full panel with all controls.

- ü•Å **Sample Kits**  
  Manage built-in and imported samples (kick, hihat, snare), randomize or load packs on demand.

- üéπ **MIDI Support**
  Use your MIDI controller to trigger actions. Custom mappings are available via UI, including key and MIDI assignments for all four loopers.

- üîÑ **Super Knob**
  Select any cue via pad, keyboard, or MIDI note and twist the mapped knob to
  slide its position left or right. Endless encoders currently act like normal
  0‚Äì127 knobs for maximum stability. Hold Shift (or a MIDI shift note) to
  reposition, and choose a speed from 1 (default) to 3 in the MIDI mapping
  window. Any CC number can be assigned.

- üëá **Touch Sequencer**  
  10 pads, 16-step sequencer, tap tempo, and BPM-based triggering.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action | Key |
|-------|-----|
| Set/Jump to Cue | Ctrl/Cmd + [1‚Äì0] |
| Audio Loopers | R / S / D / F |
| Video Looper | V |
| EQ Toggle | E |
| Compressor Toggle | C |
| Reverb Toggle | Q |
| Cassette Toggle | W |
| Undo / Redo | U / Cmd+U |
| Erase Loop A | Cmd+R |
| Erase Loop B | Cmd+S |
| Erase Loop C | Cmd+D |
| Erase Loop D | Cmd+F |
| Erase All Loops | Cmd+Option+R |
| Erase Video Loop | Cmd+V |
| Export | Ctrl/Cmd + Enter |
| Pitch Down / Up | `,` / `.` |
| Random Cue | `-` |
| Nova Bass | N |
| Blind Mode | B |
| Show Advanced Panel | A |

Press **N** or the advanced panel‚Äôs **Instrument** button to show the Nova Bass window. Opening the window activates your last preset if the synth was off; closing it powers the synth down. The minimal bar has its own Instrument button that simply toggles the synth on or off without opening the window. Three built-in bass presets‚ÄîResonate, Precision and 808 Boom‚Äîprovide classic boombap tones and play at **15% volume** by default.
While the synth is active, the `1‚Äì0` keys plus `-` and `=` play a chromatic scale from the chosen octave. The **Scale** dropdown lets you switch to major or minor if desired.
The synth has a pitch fader synced to the video by default. Uncheck **Sync Video** to adjust it independently and use the transpose slider for coarse tuning. All parameters are adjusted with labeled sliders so you know exactly what each one does.

Moving any knob instantly updates the current preset. Built‚Äëin presets cannot be deleted but you can save your tweaks as new ones. Each preset stores oscillator type, engine, filter, ADSR, effects and **Mode** (poly, mono or legato).

Each preset stores oscillator type, engine, filter settings, ADSR envelope and effect parameters (delay, reverb, volume and LFO). Use **Save** to keep changes, **Delete** to remove custom presets or **Export** to share them. The **Random** button quickly generates a usable sound.

All loop keys and MIDI notes can be reassigned in the Key Mapping and MIDI Mapping windows.
Holding the MIDI Shift note while pressing a loop note erases that loop.

## Touch Sequencer

- Press `T` to open
- Press `S` to start/stop
- Set cue points on pads or trigger them
- Use the 16-step grid to play cues rhythmically
- Tap tempo, erase steps, or close the window anytime

## Compressors

- **Native:** Hard, clear compression.
- **Ultra Tape:** Vintage saturation, SP303-inspired.
- **Bright Open:** Bright and clean compression with analog warmth.

> üîä *Tip: Reduce YouTube volume to ~40‚Äì50% for best effect with compression modes.*
