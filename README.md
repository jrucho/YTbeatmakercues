# YTbeatmakercues
Mark cue points, play drum sounds, and customize your experience on YouTube.
The extension supports managing multiple sample packs at once. Use the multi-
select dropdown in the advanced panel to load several packs together or delete
unused ones. Creating a new pack only asks for a name; you can later import
kicks, hihats and snares using each rowâ€™s "Imp" button. Samples are stored in
the pack and persist between sessions. You can delete individual samples from
any pack; built-in samples remain protected, but extra ones you add to the
built-in pack can be removed.

## Packaging a release

Run ./build_release.sh to create ytbeatmakercues-<version>.zip containing all extension files. Load the archive in Chrome via "Load unpacked" or "Pack extension".
