# YTbeatmakercues
Mark cue points, play drum sounds, and customize your experience on YouTube.
The extension now supports managing multiple sample packs. Use the new
dropdown in the advanced panel to switch packs, import your own sets of
samples, or delete unused packs. When creating a pack you'll be prompted to
select kicks, then hihats, then snares. Each sample can also be removed
individually from non built-in packs.

## Packaging a release

Run ./build_release.sh to create ytbeatmakercues-<version>.zip containing all extension files. Load the archive in Chrome via "Load unpacked" or "Pack extension".
