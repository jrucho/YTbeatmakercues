Mark cue points, loop audio/video, apply live effects, and customize your beatmaking experience on YouTube.

The **YouTube Beatmaker Cues** extension supports precise pitch adjustments, audio and video looping, effects toggling, and intuitive cue management. Use keyboard shortcuts or the detailed Advanced Panel for quick control.

## New in 1.2.1
* Works inside the YouTube iframe on [Samplette.io](https://samplette.io) and other `youtube-nocookie.com` embeds, even when the referrer is hidden. The toolbar becomes scrollable and MIDI features are disabled there.
* Minimal bar and advanced window become scrollable when space is limited
* Route audio to any available output device via the **Audio Out** dropdown ("Default output" preselected)
* Choose your microphone via the **Audio In** dropdown ("Default input" preselected)
* Choose a device from the **Monitor In** dropdown and toggle **Mon On/Off** to hear that source through your computer's default speakers. Monitoring starts off on each page load and stops cleanly when you navigate away.
* Output routing adjusts automatically when selecting a new device
* Lower latency when switching outputs using native sink routing when supported
* Input monitoring uses a separate low-latency `AudioContext` for minimal delay
* Advanced control buttons now display in two columns for easier access
* Cue Adjust knob keeps scrolling even when absolute controllers hit their limits
  (tested with CC 3 and CC 38). Hold Shift to reset a 0–127 knob before
  continuing.
* Avoids duplicate initialization in YouTube iframes to prevent freezes
* Mic button cycles Off → Record (green) → Monitor (red) so you can hear the mic while capturing loops
* Adjust cue points live using a single MIDI knob

The extension supports managing multiple sample packs at once. Use the multi-
select dropdown in the advanced panel to load several packs together or delete
unused ones. Creating a new pack only asks for a name; you can later import
kicks, hihats and snares using each row’s "Imp" button. Samples are stored in
the pack and persist between sessions. You can delete individual samples from
any pack; built-in samples remain protected, but extra ones you add to the
built-in pack can be removed.

Manage multiple compressors (Native, Tape Warm, Roland SP404OG) to shape your audio character. Adjust settings effortlessly through a user-friendly interface.

Integrate MIDI controllers with customizable mappings to trigger cues, samples, and effects directly.

Samples and cue points persist between sessions. Easily export loops, manage cues, and maintain workflow efficiency.

## Key Features

- 🎯 **Cue Points**  
  Set up to 10 visual cue points on any YouTube video. Use keyboard shortcuts or drag & drop markers.

- 🔁 **Audio & Video Loopers**  
  Record loops in sync with video or audio (shortcuts: `R` for audio, `V` for video). Double press to erase.

- 🎚️ **Pitch Control**  
  Independent pitch control for video and loop playback.

- 🎛️ **Live Effects**  
  Toggle EQ (`E`), Compressor (`C`), Reverb (`Q`), and Cassette (`W`) in real time.

- 👁️ **Minimal & Advanced UI**  
  Choose between a clean minimal bar or a full panel with all controls.

- 🥁 **Sample Kits**  
  Manage built-in and imported samples (kick, hihat, snare), randomize or load packs on demand.

- 🎹 **MIDI Support**
  Use your MIDI controller to trigger actions. Custom mappings available via UI.

- 🔄 **Cue Adjust Knob**
  Select any cue via pad, keyboard, or MIDI note and twist the mapped knob to
  slide its position left or right. Endless encoders scroll indefinitely. For
  standard 0–127 knobs, hold the Shift key (or MIDI shift note) to reposition the
  knob without moving the cue, then release Shift and continue scrolling. Any CC
  number can be assigned.

- 👇 **Touch Sequencer**  
  10 pads, 16-step sequencer, tap tempo, and BPM-based triggering.
