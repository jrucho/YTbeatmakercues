# YTbeatmakercues
Mark cue points, play drum sounds, and customize your experience on YouTube.
The extension now supports managing multiple sample packs at once. Use the new
multi-select dropdown in the advanced panel to load several packs together or
delete unused ones. Create a pack by entering a nameâ€”an empty folder is added
to the list. Use the import buttons beside each drum type to load kicks,
hihats, or snares into the currently selected pack. Samples from user-created
packs can be removed individually; the built-in pack cannot be edited.

## Packaging a release

Run ./build_release.sh to create ytbeatmakercues-<version>.zip containing all extension files. Load the archive in Chrome via "Load unpacked" or "Pack extension".
