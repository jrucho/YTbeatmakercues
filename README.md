# Update 1.2 beta
Mark cue points, play drum sounds, and customize your experience on YouTube,
Samplette.io, and SoundCloud.
The extension supports managing multiple sample packs at once. Use the multi-
select dropdown in the advanced panel to load several packs together or delete
unused ones. Creating a new pack only asks for a name; you can later import
kicks, hihats and snares using each row’s "Imp" button. Samples are stored in
the pack and persist between sessions. You can delete individual samples from
any pack; built-in samples remain protected, but extra ones you add to the
built-in pack can be removed.

# YouTube Beatmaker Cues

![Screenshot 2025-06-06 at 19 38 10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc70d22d-c90a-4b66-9c4a-b66f001cdcc5)

Mark cue points, loop audio/video, apply live effects, and customize your beatmaking experience on YouTube, Samplette.io, and SoundCloud.

The **YouTube Beatmaker Cues** extension supports precise pitch adjustments, audio and video looping, effects toggling, and intuitive cue management. Use keyboard shortcuts or the detailed Advanced Panel for quick control.

Manage multiple compressors (Native, Tape Warm, Roland SP404OG) to shape your audio character. Adjust settings effortlessly through a user-friendly interface.

Integrate MIDI controllers with customizable mappings to trigger cues, samples, and effects directly. A background service worker captures MIDI input on behalf of pages so controllers continue to work even when a site blocks WebMIDI.

Samples and cue points persist between sessions. Easily export loops, manage cues, and maintain workflow efficiency.

## Key Features

- 🎯 **Cue Points**  
  Set up to 10 visual cue points on any supported video or audio track. Use keyboard shortcuts or drag & drop markers.

- 🔁 **Audio & Video Loopers**  
  Record loops in sync with video or audio (shortcuts: `R` for audio, `V` for video). Double press to erase.

- 🎚️ **Pitch Control**  
  Independent pitch control for video and loop playback.

  Toggle EQ (`E`), Compressor (`C`), Reverb (`Q`), and Cassette (`W`) in real time.

- 👁️ **Minimal & Advanced UI**  
Choose between a clean minimal bar or a full panel with all controls.
On Samplette.io the bar only appears inside the embedded player and resizes to
its width. On SoundCloud the bar is fixed at the bottom of the page.

- 🥁 **Sample Kits**  
  Manage built-in and imported samples (kick, hihat, snare), randomize or load packs on demand.

- 🎹 **MIDI Support**  
  Use your MIDI controller to trigger actions. Custom mappings available via UI.

- 👇 **Touch Sequencer**  
  10 pads, 16-step sequencer, tap tempo, and BPM-based triggering.
