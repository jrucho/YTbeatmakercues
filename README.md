# YTbeatmakercues
Mark cue points, play drum sounds, and customize your experience on YouTube.
The extension now supports managing multiple sample packs at once. Use the new
multi-select dropdown in the advanced panel to load several packs together,
import your own sets of samples, or delete unused packs. When creating a pack
you'll be prompted to select kicks, then hihats, then snares. Each sample can
also be removed individually from non built-in packs.

## Packaging a release

Run ./build_release.sh to create ytbeatmakercues-<version>.zip containing all extension files. Load the archive in Chrome via "Load unpacked" or "Pack extension".
